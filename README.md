This is a simple inventory system designed to work with Love2d/LÃ–VE but it can work with anything that runs Lua
it's supposed to be a slightly watered down version of Fallout 3/New Vegas's list type inventory system

What it does:
-Handle adding and removing items
-Checking if an inventory has an item
-Being lightweight and scalable

What it can't do:
-Saving and loading (although it does have functions that allow you to work with libraries/code that can do that)
-UI (although you can add that on your own)
-Item durability
-Inventory slots (like minecraft's)
